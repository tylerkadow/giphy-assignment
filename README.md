# Giphy-Assignment

The giphy api (application program interface) is a resource for gif images. We can utilize this api and create many different applications.

With this application, I created a simple search engine for giphy images. I also wanted this app to be safe for kids, so I had the search remove all results that are rated "R" by the giphy api.

This application's code also utilizes jQuery to save some time with the coding.
